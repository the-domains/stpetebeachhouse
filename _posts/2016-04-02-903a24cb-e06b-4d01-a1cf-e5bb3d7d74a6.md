description: 'has a permanent population of about 10,032, but is also a popular winter residence for people living in other parts of the United States, Canada and Europe. Nearly 28 percent of the total residential homes and condominiums in St. Pete Beach are owned by people claiming primary residence elsewhere, reflecting a high volume of seasonal visitors.  Tourism is an integral part of St. Pete Beach’s economy. We’re within 30 miles of both St. Petersburg-Clearwater International Airport and Tampa International Airport. A clean, safe public transportation system, the Suncoast Beach Trolley, allows for easy accessibility throughout the area.'
